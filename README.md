# cotton-fleahopper-pop-gen
Contains scripts for analyses of population genomics of cotton fleahopper used in published research

Howdy reader!

The scripts in this repository were used for the investigation of population genomic structure in temporally repeated samplings of cotton fleahopper (Pseudatomoscelis seriatus) individuals collected from a variety of host plants over two years. The data analyzed using these scripts was generated using doube digest RADseq. The majority of these scripts were executed on the "Ada" cluster located at Texas A&M University, so some of the commands may be specific to job submission on that cluster. Specific scripts included here are for (1) filtering of possible bacterial contamination, (2) identification of informative SNP loci, and (3) quality filtering of SNP loci.
